# A Bit of History


# IPython Notebook

<img src="https://github.com/rmorshea/talks/raw/master/idom/what-is-idom/static/ipython-notebook.png" style="height:550px" />

<!--

~2010-2012

The browser was becoming the OS of the internet.

Python, being a backend language had to adapt.

Did so in the form of the IPython Notebook, now Jupyter

# IPyWidgets

<img src="https://github.com/rmorshea/talks/raw/master/idom/what-is-idom/static/ipywidgets-interaction.gif" />

<!--

~2012-2014

as part of this project to bring Python to the browser

IPyWidgets was created.

Allowed Python to have bidirectional comms with DOM and Javascript

used Notebook APIs

This helped to spur Python's popularity amongst scientists

# Javascript Frameworks


# A Paradigm Shift

<img src="https://github.com/rmorshea/talks/raw/master/idom/what-is-idom/static/js-shift-to-declarative.png" />

<!--

2015-2017 new declarative Javascript frameworks gained popularity

Old imperative frameworks like Angular quickly went out of fashion

While there are many fads in the JS world declarative frameworks
and React specifically seem to have staying power.

Why though?

-->


# Declarative vs Imperative?

- [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) - uses statements that change a program's state.
- [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) - expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

<!--

- according to wikipedia...

- means that:
  - describe state of app at each step
  - the programming framework handles transitions

Why is that better?

one less thing for programmer to worry about
