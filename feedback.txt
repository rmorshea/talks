expand a little bit more in imperative vs declarative

explain React is a javascript framework

make sure code examples fit on

maybe live demo at the end - make toy app

go more into how you can go farther with Python

maybe talk about DB

how it works
- VDOM
- MVC

"javascript is written for you"
- it's under the covers
- sometimes things work out the box
- rely on ecosystem to be filled out by people who know JS
^
this can slot into JS just works section

make sure someone can create a toy example


What are the take aways
write down the list make sure talk does it

- JS frameworks have shifted to declarative
  - Python frameworks haven't
- IDOM is declarative
  - it's declarative because it copies React
- It's easy to make stuff with IDOM
  - show toy app to explain that


----


state the understanding the details of VDOM
not important

better explain VDOM is an intermediate

rephrase JS integration from object to just statement

for demo

- ask for people following along
- most people in-person will not
- use as opportunity to mention "ecosystem independence"

good are artists copy great artists steel
frontend frameowrk on the backend

dog vdom analogy?


show magic of hooks, but don't explain
explain, but don't tell everything about hook feature.

in demo
live code a JS
